#[Quiz 3] Academic Norms and Ethics.

Please finish the following questions:

1. What's the definition of plagiarism and multiple submissions? (2pt)

Privately copy other people's articles and works as their own for publication, and are substantially similar; regardless of reality, copy other people's thoughts, methods, experience, etc. We call these two phenomena plagiarism.

“Multiple submissions” means sending more than one story to the same publisher or anthology call at once. Some publishers are fine with multiple submissions; they want to decide for themselves which of your pieces will suit them best.

2. Please learn about the Schön scandal and analyze the academic misconduct involved (in 50 words). (3pt)

after Schön published his work on single-molecule semiconductors, others in the physics community alleged that his data contained anomalies. Lydia Sohn, then of Princeton University, noticed that two experiments carried out at very different temperatures had identical noise. When the editors of Nature pointed this out to Schön, he claimed to have accidentally submitted the same graph twice. Paul McEuen of Cornell University then found the same noise in a paper describing a third experiment. In a word,The misconduct he was involved in included cheating,plagiarism and multiple submissions.
